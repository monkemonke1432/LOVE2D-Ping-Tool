# LOVE2D-Ping-Tool
A simple ping tool made in LOVE2D.


For Windows:
1: Extract the .zip
2: Execute (run) the .exe file
3: that's literally it lol


For Mac/Linux
1: Extract the .zip
2: Use Wine/Q4Wine + Winetricks to execute the file (If you'd like, go into "Override DLLS" and choose "Built-In, Native".
3: that's it (idk if Q4Wine and/or Winetricks are available for mac since I don't own one)
