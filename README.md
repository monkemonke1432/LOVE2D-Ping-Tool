# LOVE2D-Ping-Tool
A simple ping tool made in LOVE2D.


For Windows:
1: Extract the .zip
2: Execute (run) the .exe file
3: that's literally it lol


For Mac/Linux
1: Extract the .zip
2: Use Wine/Q4Wine + Winetricks to execute the file (If you'd like, go into "Override DLLS" and choose "Built-In, Native".
3: that's it (idk if Q4Wine and/or Winetricks are available for mac since I don't own one)

MORE INFO:
If you'd like to use this easier (this is primarily for Mac/Linux users), you can download the .love version and run "love LOVE2D-Ping-Tool.love" if you have LOVE2D installed. I don't know if this works on mac, though.
